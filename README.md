The DriverPass project was focused on creating a system who wanted a comprehensive platform to help students prepare for their driving tests. The system needed to offer both online driving lessons and in-person training, with the ability to book, modify, and cancel lessons. It also required multiple levels of access, from students to administrators, and the ability to log changes for security purposes.

One area where I excelled was in clearly defining the system's functional requirements and ensuring that all necessary features were addressed. 

If I had to revise one part of my work, I would focus on refining the non-functional requirements, particularly around security. I would provide more detailed strategies for handling platform updates and potential security threats, ensuring the system remains secure.

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on creating a user friendly system that addressed all the functional requirements, such as lesson scheduling and progress tracking. It's crucial to consider the user’s needs in system design because the success of the system depends on how well it serves its users. If their needs aren't met, the system could fail or be utilized ineffectively.

When designing software, I take a structured approach, starting with a good understanding of the requirements and then breaking down the design into manageable components. Moving forward, I would keep using techniques like creating use case diagrams to visualize the system early on. Also, I would prioritize user feedback throughout the development process to ensure the final product meets their expectations.
